      Families hanging out, birds minding their own business. Instead, we\u2019ve
      got a picturesque view of pure filth. Makes you wonder what\u2019s wrong with
      folks."

      the trash doesn\u2019t show up to begin with. We need to educate these folks,
      or at least leave a system in place to keep this park maintained after we\u2019re
      done. Otherwise, we\u2019re just slapping a bandage on a gaping wound."

      not always about fighting mega-parasites or shutting down black-market labs.
      Sometimes it\u2019s dealing with this: the everyday filth that people leave
